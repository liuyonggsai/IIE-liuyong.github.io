* I received my Master's and Ph.D Degrees in Tianjin University, 2016, Tianjin, China; I am currently an associate researcher at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China.

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in large scale machine learning, autoML and model selection.
